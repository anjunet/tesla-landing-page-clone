## Overview
The Tesla Landing Page Clone replicates the minimalist and sleek design of Tesla's homepage. 
It includes a navigation bar with a logo, menu items, and icons, a background image that covers the entire page, and two call-to-action buttons with a subtle rounded corner effect. 
This clone showcases basic web design principles using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling.

## Features

-**Navigation Bar**: Positioned at the top of the page, it features:
  - A Tesla logo on the left.
  - Menu items in the center.
  - Icons on the right for additional options (like account or search).
-**Full-Page Background Image**: The background image spans 100% of the landing page, providing a visually engaging backdrop that reflects the clean design style of Tesla.
-**Call-to-Action Buttons**:
  - Two buttons are centrally positioned over the background image.
  - They feature a border-radius of 5px, giving them a modern, rounded appearance.

## Technologies Used

-**HTML5**: Used to define the structure of the page, including the navigation bar, background image, and buttons.
-**CSS3**: Used for styling the page, positioning elements, setting up the full-page background image, and applying hover effects and border-radius styling to the buttons.

## Customization

-**Navigation Ba**r: Change the logo or modify menu items to suit your design. The items and logo can be updated directly in the HTML and styled in styles.css.
-**Background Image**: Update the background image by replacing the image source in the CSS file under the background property. Ensure the image covers 100% of the page for a full-screen effect.
-**Buttons**: Adjust the styling of the buttons (size, color, hover effects) in styles.css. You can also change the border-radius value for a more or less rounded appearance.
